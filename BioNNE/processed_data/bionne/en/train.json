    "text": "[Functional morphology of ischemic cardiomyopathy]. OBJECTIVE To show that ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) that is generally believed to be a variant of chronic heart disease (CHD) and an analogue of chronic heart failure is an initial stage and the background of all further forms of CHD. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Sixty cardiac biopsies obtained from patients during aortocoronary bypass surgery for CHD and myocardia from 55 rabbits in which the investigators simulated atherosclerosis over time, as well as acute, transient, and recurrent coronary insufficiency after vasopressin administration were examined. A number of adequate histological, histochemical, and immunohistological procedures, electron microscopic and electron histochemical studies, and morphometry were employed.  The investigators made biochemical monitoring of blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels and ECG monitoring in the animals had received intravenous vasopressin. RESULTS  The authors have indicated that CHD begins with endothelial changes in the trophic component of the microhemocirculatory bed, which gives rise to its impaired blood flow and to hypoxia at the level of the myocardial structural and functional unit--fascicules. Over time, the disease develops a set of processes that cause damage to microvessels, cardiomyocytes, stroma, lymph capillaries, and nerve endings and changes in secretion.  Compensatory and adaptive responses that long mask the symptoms of damage to the vascular bed and myocardial tissue take place simultaneously. The occurring lesions result in irregular diffuse cardiosclerosis, micro- and lymphocirculatory, innervation, and conduction disturbances, and irregular cardiomyocyte damage. The authors consider this set of myocardial changes to be an initial phase of ICM that shows no clinical manifestation at all.  As coronary atherosclerosis progresses, the already damaged myocardium is superimposed by the morphological changes caused by higher hypoxia at the whole organ level. Depending upon a combination of these changes, one or another form of CHD and progression of chronic CHD may prevail at a later time. CONCLUSION ICM is a broader concept than chronic heart failure and it is a basis for the pathogenesis and morphogenesis of CHD. ",

    "text": "UNLABELLED  The authors present the material of their study of the morphological and molecular biological features of damage to the stem cell niches (SCN) in the respiratory acini of the lung and the significance of their occurring changes in the pathogenesis of chronic idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP), including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) with bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). SUBJECTS AND METHODS The study was performed using open transthoracic (n=181) and transbronchial (n=71) lung biopsies from 194 patients (118 cases (61%) with IPF, 35 (18%) with NSIP, 23 (12%) with DIP, 18 (9%) with COP + BO). The serial paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and van Gieson's picrofuchsin and immunohistochemical reactions were carried out to detect MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-7, Apo-Cas (\"Novocastra\", 1:100), vimentin (Vimentin) (\"LabVision\" 1:100), SMA (\"LabVision\", 1:100), TGF-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, CD34, Ost-4, and CD117 (\"Dako\", 1:50), CD68, and EMA (\"Dako\", 1:100). Biotinylated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibodies (\"Dako\" LSAB + KIT, PEROXIDASE) were used as secondary antibodies. All the quantitative and semi-quantitative data obtained were processed by variation statistics. RESULTS The compared IIPs were shown to differ in the site and degree of initial and secondary respiratory acinus damages caused by the aggressiveness of an inflammatory infiltrate and the spread of a lesion to different SCN areas involved in the regeneration of lung tissue. The mesenchymal cell with myofibroblast differentiation, which is probably associated with a mesenchymal stem cell, as evidenced by Oct-4, Vimentin, SMA, CD117, and CD34 expression by these cells, may be considered to be a marker cell of deep SCN damage. CONCLUSION The author state that the clinical course and degree of morphological changes in IPP directly depend on the severity and depth of damage to the SCN areas of the respiratory acinus. ",

    "text": "[Pulmonary paecilomycosis: Diagnosis and treatment]. AIM  To represent the advances of Russia and Uzbekistan in studying the problem of paecilomycosis. The goal of the investigation was to develop the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary paecilomycosis (PP). SUBJECTS AND METHODS Two hundred and twenty-five people, including 200 patients with bronchopulmonary infection with fungi of the Paecilomyces genus and 25 clinically healthy individuals (a control group), were examined. Clinico-anamnestic, laboratory diagnostic, mycological, and immunological studies were conducted; a lymphocyte antigen-binding test was used for differential diagnosis. Paecilomyces infection was diagnosed by microscopically examining the morphology of the fungi in the pathological material (blood, sputum) and by isolating the cultured fungi in the media (Sabouraud's and Czapek's ones). The severe complication of PP - atypical paecilomycosis-associated myocarditis (APAM) - was studied in 112 patients with helminthiasis-complicated paecilomycosis. These patients underwent using the conventional echocardiography. RESULTS Bronchopulmonary paecilomycosis resulting from primary and secondary infection with fungi of the Paecilomyces genus was clinically manifested as chronic obstructive bronchitis (11.5%), recurrent pneumonia (13.5%), exogenous allergic alveolitis (37%), and asthma (26%) complicated by helminthiasis (12%). Iodine deficiency promotes the prevalence of paecilomycosis and echinococcosis favors Paecilomycosis infection; moreover, the helminth capsule itself serves as a nutrient medium for the development of the mycelial form of the fungus. APAM is a severe complication of PP. Almost 50% of the patients with PP presented with carditis. The patients with APAM occasionally experienced fear and the most severe intermittent pain. The latter first occurred in the chest.and irradiated to the axilla, left hand, and its fingertips, paralyzing the arm. In some patients, the pain manifested itself in both arms with abdominal irradiation, by being accompanied by faints. Current analgesics (meloxicam, tizanidine, nimesulide, morphine, promedole) in combination with fluconazole provided a temporary positive effect. CONCLUSION Further investigations that must also include neurologists and anesthetists are required to work out effective pain relief regimens for APAM in patients with PP. ",

The objective of the present study was to determine the diagnostic coefficients (DC) for the injuries to the upper and lower extremities of the vehicle drivers inflicted inside the passenger compartment in the case of a traffic accident. We have analysed the archival expert documents collected from 45 regional bureaus of forensic medical expertise during the period from 1995 to 2014 that contained the results of examination of 200 corpses and 300 survivors who had suffered injuries in the traffic accidents. The statistical and mathematical treatment of these materials with the use of sequential mathematical analysis based on the Bayes and Wald formulas yielded diagnostic coefficients that make it possible to elucidate the most informative features characterizing the driver of a vehicle.  In case of a lethal outcome, the most significant injuries include bleeding from the posterior left elbow region (DC +7.6), skin scratches on the palm surface of the right wrist (DC +7.6), bleeding from the postrerior region of the left lower leg (DC +7.6), wounds on the dorsal surface of the left wrist (DC +6.3), bruises at the anterior surface of the left knee (DC +6.3), etc. The most informative features in the survivals of the traffic accidents are bone fractures (DC +7.0), tension of ligaments and dislocation of the right talocrural joint (DC +6.5), fractures of the left kneecap and left tibial epiphysis (DC +5.4), hemorrhage and bruises in the anterior right knee region (DC + 5.4 each), skin scratches in the right posterior carpal region (DC +5.1).  It is concluded that the use of the diagnostic coefficients makes it possible to draw the attention of the experts to the above features and to objectively determine the driver's seat position inside the car passenger compartment in the case of a traffic accident. Moreover such an approach contributes to the improvement of the quality of expert conclusions and the results of forensic medical expertise of the circumstance of traffic accidents. ",

Another objective was the forensic medical evaluation of these injuries from the standpoint of harm to human health. A total of 80 cases of death from neck injuries were available for the analysis.  These subjects underwent tracheal intubation prior to death that was performed either by an ambulance crew or in a hospital setting. Forty of these patients had the blunt neck trauma inflicted in the preceding period.  It was shown that tracheal intubation leads in 60% of the patients to isolated or combined fractures of the sublingual bone, laryngeal and tracheal cartilages in the form of the injuries to the greater horns of the hyoid bone and the inferior horns of the thyroid cartilage, fissures in the arch of the cricoid cartilage, sometimes cracks and complete fractures of the tracheal cartilages, and breaks of the connections between the hyoid bone body and its greater horns. The scope of the injuries in the neck region is larger and their severity higher when intubation is performed in the patients with the blunt neck trauma compared with the subjects undergoing intubation in the absence of previous external injurious impacts. It is concluded that forensic medical expertise and examination of the corpses of the subjects who had undergone tracheal intubation prior to death coming should include the removal of the entire complex of the neck organs together with the unopened larynx and the cervical portion of the trachea. Differential diagnostics of the injuries inflicted by tracheal intubation following the blunt neck trauma should be performed only by means of the comprehensive assessment of the external defects and the fractures of the constituents of the hyoid-laryngeal-tracheal complex using the graphical and vector methods of analysis.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of surgical treatment of lumbar vertebral canal stenosis based on the study of patient's pain and emotional status, quality of life and level of disability before and after surgical treatment.  MATERIAL AND METHODS A complex examination of 163 patients with lumbar vertebral canal stenosis was carried out.  The visual analogous scale, Paindetect (PD) and Douleur neuropathique 4 (DN4), the Chronic Pain Coping Inventory, the Oswestry low back pain disability questionnaire were used. Affective disorders were measured using Beck depression scale.  Blood serum and thrombocytic serotonin were determined with ELISA. Patients were examined at admission before the surgery, at discharge from the hospital after surgical treatment and one year after the surgery. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Before surgery, the patients had chronic pain syndrome of mixed etiology (nociceptive and neurotic type) and neurological disorders that significantly affected quality of life and work capacity.  Neuropathic pain and depression, reduced quality of life and daily activities were more pronounced in patients with central canal stenosis compared to patients with lateral stenosis. The timely surgical treatment of lumbar vertebral canal stenosis promoted the decompression of nervous structures.

OBJECTIVE To study E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases in order to assess the impact of different drug therapy regimens on the adhesive properties of tumor cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS Intraoperative metastatic CRC samples from patients who had received preoperative cytotoxic chemotherapy or combined cytotoxic and targeted anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) therapy were immunohistochemically examined using antibodies to E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin.  A comparison group consisted of patients who had not received drug therapy. RESULTS  Combined therapy with cytotoxic and anti-VEGF agents was shown to result in a significant increase in the number of cases of normal membrane localization of E-cadherin as compared with control (p = 0.00043) and cytotoxic therapy-alone (p = 0.01) groups. A comparison of \u03b2-catenin levels in three patient groups revealed no significant differences, but addition of an anti-VEGF agent caused some decrease in the number of cases of abnormal nuclear localization of the protein as compared to both the control group and the cytotoxic therapy groups.  The comparison of E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin localization in tumor cells showed that a combination of normal E-cadherin membrane localization and \u03b2-catenin membrane-cytoplasmic expression prevailed in the combined therapy group compared to the control (p = 0.009) and cytotoxic therapy (p = 0.04) groups. CONCLUSION The addition of a targeted anti-VEGF agent to the drug therapy of metastatic CRC has a positive impact on the cadherin-catenin complex, leading to increased intercellular contacts and suppressed \u03b2-catenin functioning as a transcription factor that enhances tumor cell proliferation.

RESULTS In Groups 1, 2, and 3, LVH was detected in 42.4, 63.6, and 80% of cases, respectively. It was not found in the control group.  In these groups, serum cystatin C levels were 1489.49 \u00b1 520.76, 2533.13 \u00b1 621.66, 5166.02 \u00b1 1586.61, and 820.08 \u00b1 224.54 ng/ml, respectively. An association was found between cystatin C and LVH (p = 0.5; p < 0.001). The level of cystatin C was shown to predict the development of LVH with a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 62% for predialysis CKD patients. Multivariate analysis of left ventricular mass index (LVMI), E-velocity/A-velocity, (E/A) ratio, and hypertension showed that the cystatin C levels were independently correlated with LVMI only (p < 0.05; p = 0.3) in all the groups. CONCLUSION Serum cystatin C levels may be regarded as an early LVH marker detectable in patients with the earliest stages of CKD. ",

AIM  To study the incidence, severity, predictive factors, and prognostic value of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CIAKI) in patients with ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STSEACS), who have undergone primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). SUBJECTS AND METHODS The 2012 KDIGO criteria were used to estimate the incidence of CIAKI in 216 patients (mean age, 64 \u00b1 13 years) admitted to Moscow City Clinical Hospital Sixty-Four and underwent primary PCI for STSEACS (hypertension in 90%, prior myocardial infarction in 27%, chronic kidney disease in 7%, type 2 diabetes mellitus in 21%). Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictive factors for CIAKI; following 12 months, its prognosis was assessed by phone. RESULTS Forty-three (20%) patients were diagnosed with Stages I (81%) and II (19%) CIAKI. The patients with CIAKI were older; they had higher baseline serum creatinine levels, a higher volume of contrast agent, a higher ratio of contrast medium volume to glomerular filtration rate, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction. Independent predictive factors for CIAKI were identified; these were chronic kidney disease, multivascular injury in the coronary bed, hospital therapy with loop diuretics, nephrotoxic antibiotics, or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. CONCLUSION The development of CIAKI is associated with poor outcomes, such as higher 30-day mortality and more frequent cardiovascular disease readmissions. ",

Arteriovenous dysplasia is rather uncommon disease, quite often leading to severe complications even in young age. Involvement of the osseous apparatus into the pathological process is frequently associated with the problem of amputation of the affected limb. Therefore, salvage of the extremity while removing arteriovenous shunt and trophic impairments is an extremely important clinical task. In the presented herein clinical case report, a female patient with arteriovenous angiodysplasia of the lower limb with the tibial bone involved into the pathological process underwent repeated stagewise embolisations, failing however to achieve complete liquidation of the arteriovenous reflux. In this connection, after removal of angiomatous tissues, requiring also excochleation of the damaged portions of the bone, in order to reinforce the axis of the tibial bone the intramedullary canal of the latter was filled with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA).

AIM We carried out an open randomized controlled study to explore the changes in the rate of speech recovery and BDNF concentrations in patients with left-hemisphere stroke and carbohydrate metabolism disorders (diabetes mellitus type2 or prediabetes) who received cerebrolysin.  MATERIAL AND METHODS A study included 60 inpatients of the Center of Speech Pathology and Neurorehabilitation. Neuropsychological examination was performed at baseline and after the treatment was completed.  We determined aphasia type and quantitatively assessed speech in scores which reflected the severity of speech impairment. BDNF serum concentrations were measured.  RESULTS Clinical efficacy of cerebrolysin (intravenously in dose 20 ml in 100 ml of physiological solution, 5 days a week, during 4 weeks) used in addition to standard neurorehabilitation measures in patients with post stroke aphasia of different severity was demonstrated.  This treatment was most effective in patients with very marked and marked speech impairment that was confirmed by the maximal possible improvement of speech during the first course of neurorehabilitation measures, in particular in a subgroup of patients without carbohydrate metabolism disorders. A significant increase in BDNF concentrations was an additional evidence of this improvement.

AIM To compare clinical and morphological results of treatment of ischemic stroke in three groups of patients which differed by the forms and duration of an antioxidant therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS  A randomized clinical trial was performed in 8 vascular centers of the Russian Federation in 2010-2014. It included 373 patients with ischemic stroke in the carotid territory.  Patients were randomized into 3 groups to receive different regimens of antioxidant therapy as an adjunct to standard therapy: control group (ascorbic acid; 132 patients); cytoflavin (20 ml per day for 10 days; 133 patients); cytoflavin (the dose was decreased to 10 ml per day from 11th to 20th day) (108 patients). Patient's condition was assessed in 1, 10 and 21 day by a complex of clinical, laboratory and instrumental methods. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The analysis of CT in 1th and 21th day revealed a significant 1,5-1,7- fold decrease in the cerebral ischemic lesion in both groups treated with cytoflavin with no significant morphologic changes in the ascorbic acid group. The percentage of patients with ischemic lesion, increased during days 1-21, was 2-fold higher in the ascorbic acid group compared to cytoflavin groups.  Morphologic changes were correlated with clinical variables and outcome. In patients with \u226514 points on NIH scale on admission, prolonged 20 day cytoflavin therapy was associated with a more prominent improvement of neurologic, functional and cognitive status compared to 10-day cytoflavin infusion.

AIM To estimate the incidence of acute myeloid leukemias (AML) in Moscow adults and to evaluate the efficiency of their treatment.  SUBJECTS AND METHODS Data on Moscow residents who were first diagnosed with AML in 2010 were retrospectively collected.  The efficiency of their treatment was evaluated from the rates of complete remissions (CR), recurrences, deaths, and 4-year overall (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). The data as of September 1, 2013, were analyzed. RESULTS According to the 2010 pooled materials of the city's municipal hematology departments, AML (non-M3 types) was diagnosed in 286 patients whose median age at diagnosis was 64.9 years (range, 18.2-92.0 years). The notified incidence rate was 2.9 (3.3 for men and 2.6 for women) cases per 100,000 population. 118 (41%) patients received intensive chemotherapy (ICT); 119 (42%) had chemotherapy with low-dose cytarabine (LDC); 7 (2%) had that with hypomethylating agents (HA); and 42 (15%) had palliative therapy (PT). During first-line therapy, none of the patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). In the entire group, the early (within the first 60 days) mortality rates were 42% (119 deaths); that of patients with primary refractory disease was 32% (90 deaths). CR was achieved in 77 (27%) patients: 57 (48%) on ICT, 17 (14%) on LDC, and 3 (43%) on HA. Recurrences occurred in 37 (48%) of the 77 patients who had achieved CR at a median follow-up of 43.9 months. Four-year OS in all the patients receiving PT was 9.8\u00b11.9% (18.2\u00b13.9% in the patients on ICT versus 4.5\u00b12% in those of LDC; p=0.028); 4-year RFS was 36.1\u00b15.7% (39.6\u00b16.7% inthe patients on ICT versus 31.3\u00b111 .6% in those on LDC; p=0.8). CONCLUSION High mortality rates in the induction, which are caused by the limited resources of accompanying therapy, poor sanitary conditions, and no own opportunities to perform allo-HSCT, remain a key problem of AML therapy in adults.

OBJECTIVE to define the role of neurotransmitters and their receptors in the development of itch and in the maintenance of a skin inflammatory response in patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.  MATERIAL AND METHODS Skin biopsy specimens from 30 patients with psoriasis and 30 patients with atopic dermatitis were investigated by histological, immunoperoxidase, and indirect immunofluorescence assays.  The investigators determined the expression of protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5), amphiregulin, semaphorin 3A, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and its receptor (CGRP-R), nerve growth factor (NGF) and its receptor TrkA, and substance P (SP) and its receptor SP-R. The indirect immunofluorescence assay was used for quantitative analysis.  The findings were statistically analyzed using a Statistica 10 program. RESULTS Immunoperoxidase examination of the skin biopsy specimens from patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis revealed enhanced expression of amphiregulin, NGF, and PGP9.5, appearance of positively stained epidermal nerve fibers, and decreased expression of the nerve reduction factor semaphorin 3A in all cases. Some patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis showed increased expression of CGRP and CGRP-R, SP, SP-R, and TrkA. A pronounced inflammatory response was generally observed in these cases. CONCLUSION  The investigation performed suggests that atopic dermatitis and psoriasis are characterized by a larger number of epidermal nerve fibers and by a direct correlation between this indicator, disease severity, and itch intensity. The production of neuropeptides and neurotrophins is closely related to the development of a skin inflammatory response irrespective of its cause and dysregulation of these processes is likely to favor the body's sensitization and the chronic pattern the course of diseases.

    "text": "[The new possibility for the treatment of acute cough].  Acute cough associated with influenza and acute respiratory viral infection (ARVI) is one of the most common complaints prompting the patient to visit a general practitioner or an otorhinolaryngologist based at the outpatient clinic. Acute cough during ARVI in the practically healthy subjects is as a rule non-productive, frequently dry, and becomes resolved within 2-3 weeks. In certain cases, however, the cough during ARVI can be productive with the well apparent abnormal expectoration of sputum especially in the aged and elderly subjects, young children, and patients suffering from the chest injuries, dry pleuritis, and other disorders.  The early prescription of mucoactive preparations can prevent the development of subacute cough. In such cases, it is recommended to use the mucokinetic ambroxol that improves the mucociliary clearance (MCC) and does not require strong exertion for sputum expectoration. An important aspect in the mechanism of action of ambroxol is the stimulation of surfactant production, antioxidation effect, the improvement of rheological properties of bronchial mucus, ant-inflammatory and antiviral effects. The application of the new pharmaceutical dose form of ambroxol, neo-bronchol (orally disintegrating tablets), produces a very rapid effect (within 1 day after the intake) due to the fast absorption of this medication in the oral cavity, its rapid penetration into the circulatory system and achievement of the high concentration in blood plasma. The volatile metabolites of ambroxol that form as a result of tablet disintegration, such as ambroxol itself, menthol, and cineol, exert the mucolytic, antiseptic, and antibacterial actions, after they reach the trachea and bronchi. Irrigation of the receptors present in the inflamed mucous membrane of the larynx, pharynx, and nasal cavity, with these volatile substances produces an immediate cough-suppressive effect.  It is concluded that the preparations of neo-bronchol (orally disintegrating tablets) can be recommended for the inclusion in the combined treatment of the patients presenting with acute and chronic diseases accompanied by the excretion of viscous and difficult-of-discharge bronchial mucus (such as acute and chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma with difficulty in sputum discharge, and bronchoectatic disease).

A six-year-old patient with non-germinomatous germ cell tumor of the chiasmatic-sellar area developed polyuria and polydipsia as the first symptoms of the disease. Then there were signs of precocious puberty and vision impairment.  MRI examination revealed a shiasmatic sellar tumor and occlusive hydrocephalus. Tumor marker levels in blood serum were elevated.  The alpha-fetoprotein level was increased 5-fold; human chorionic gonadotropin 20-fold. These levels increased over time.  The patient received 2 cycles of PEI multiagent chemotherapy (Ifosfamide 1.5 g/m(2), Cisplatin 20 mg/m(2), Etoposide 100 mg/m(2)) during 5 days and 1 cycle of second-line multiagent chemotherapy (Cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) for 1 day and Endoxan 1500 mg/m(2) for 2 days). Despite the decrease in tumor marker levels to normal values, the patient's vision still deteriorated. MRI examination revealed that tumor size increased and its structure changed. Total tumor resection led to vision improvement and regression of intracranial hypertension. Histological analysis of tumor tissue only revealed a mature teratoma. This phenomenon, known as growing teratoma syndrome, is very rare among patients with intracranial non-germinomatous germ cell tumors. ",

    "text": "[Supracerebellar transtentorial approach to tumors of the posterior portions of the medial temporal region].  OBJECTIVE Despite the advances in microsurgery, the choice of the most adequate approach to the posterior part of the medial temporal region (MTR) remains a very controversial issue.  The supracerebellar transtentorial approach (STA) is considered as the most preferable one, since it provides the optimal balance between retraction, incision, and resection of the brain tissue. Here, we present our consecutive series of 20 patients who underwent STA surgery.  MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty patients with glial tumors affecting the posterior MTR underwent STA surgery between 2006 and 2014. The mean age of the patients was 20 years. Benign tumors were predominant (18 out of 20 cases). RESULTS Resection of the posterior and middle MTRs was conducted in 16 cases.  The anterior MTR was accessed through STA in 1 patient only; in 2 patients, STA was combined with the infraoccipital approach. Cerebellar edema occurred in 4 patients, with hemiparesis persisting in one of the cases for 1 year after surgery. Of 8 patients with drug resistant epilepsy, the Engel class 1 or 2 outcome was achieved in 6 cases within 1 year after surgery. CONCLUSION STA provides an excellent surgical route to the posterior and middle MTR portions; however, the anterior MTR portions cannot be reached safely. The operative risks of STA increase as the surgeon proceeds with resection of the anterior MTR portions. Anterior MTR structures can be removed using a combination of the supracerebellar and infraoccipital transtentorial approaches or two-stage resection. ",

It is unclear if current programmes in China can achieve the post-2015 global targets for tuberculosis - 50% reduction in incidence and a 75% reduction in mortality by 2025. Chinese policy-makers need to maintain the recent decline in the prevalence of tuberculosis, while revising control policies to cope with an epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis and the effects of ongoing health reform. Health reforms are expected to shift patients from tuberculosis dispensaries to designated hospitals. We developed a mathematical model of tuberculosis control in China to help set appropriate targets and prioritize interventions that might be implemented in the next 10\u00a0years. This model indicates that, even under the most optimistic scenario - improved treatment in tuberculosis dispensaries, introduction of a new effective regimen for the treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis and optimal care of cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis - the current global targets for tuberculosis are unlikely to be reached.  However, reductions in the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis should be feasible. We conclude that a shift of patients from tuberculosis dispensaries to designated hospitals is likely to hamper efforts at tuberculosis control if cure rates in the designated hospitals cannot be maintained at a high level.  Our results can inform the planning of tuberculosis control in China. ",

Authors reviewed the literature on the efficacy of chondroprotectors in the treatment of chronic pain syndromes in comparison with placebo and other analgesics to discover the own antinociceptive effect of these drugs and mechanisms by which it occurs. Authors evaluated the results of various clinical studies on the effect of symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis (SYSADOA) on chronic pain syndrome in osteoarthritis and low back pain.  We compared their effects with those of NSAIDs, celecoxib, or placebo. Assessment of pain and functional status was performed using WOMAC, VASandLeken's index as well as the Roland--Morrisquality of life questionnaire.  The review of a number of clinical studies revealed a definite antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effect of SYSADOA comparable with NSAIDs not only in the treatment of osteoarthritis, but also in chronic back pain, which is characterized by early onset and gradual development with a long-term retention of the result even after discontinuation of therapy. It has been shown that SYSADOA are able to reduce the level of inflammatory cytokines in the blood (IL-6, C-reactive protein) and to activate the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the synovial membrane.  It is shown that blocking of the effects of interleukin 1-beta and thereby inhibition of inflammatory enzymes like nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 is one of the points of glucosamine chondrocytes application. The data obtained in numerous studies that confirm the ability of SYSADOA to inhibit proinflammatory cytokines open the new perspectives for their use in the treatment of not only joint pain but also other chronic pain syndromes.

AIM To investigate the clinical effectiveness of pioglitazone in the combination treatment of patients with asthma concurrent with coronary heart disease (CHD).  SUBJECTS AND METHODS Fifty patients aged 40-75 years with asthma concurrent with CHD were examined.  External respiratory function (ERF), electrocardiograms, blood pressure (BP), and anthropometric measurements were assessed in all the patients. Blood and urine laboratory values and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentrations were estimated; endothelial function was determined measuring endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilation (EDVD and EIVD). The patients were randomized into a comparison group receiving only standard therapy and a study group taking pioglitazone as part of combination therapy for 3 months. RESULTS At the randomization stage prior to pioglitazone combination therapy, the patient groups did not statistically significantly differ in basic clinical and anamnestic data.  Three-month standard therapy resulted in stabilization of ERF and endothelial function. During the treatment, there were increases in the frequency of asthma symptoms and the duration of angina attacks, however, there was a decline in hs-CRP levels (p<0.001). Incorporation of pioglitazone into the standard treatment regimen of patients with asthma concurrent with CHD improved clinical disease control, decreased the degree of bronchial obstruction and the frequency of angina pain and asthma attacks using nitroglycerin and salbutamol, lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure, improved EDVD (increases in the maximum linear velocity of blood flow after a test for reactive hyperemia (RH), index of reactivity (IR), and A% brachial artery (BA) diameter) and EIVD (increases in IR and A% BA diameter), and reduced systemic inflammation from hs-CRP values (p<0.001) and hypercholesterolemia from total cholesterol levels (p<0.02). CONCLUSION The incorporation of pioglitazone in the combination therapy of patients with asthma concurrent with CHD improves the clinical course of the diseases and increases their control, reduces systemic inflammation, and improves endothelial functional activity.

In the last five\u00a0years there has been good progress in podoconiosis research and control. Addressing poverty at household level and infrastructure development such as roads, water and urbanization can all help to reduce podoconiosis incidence. Specific control methods include the use of footwear, regular foot hygiene and floor coverings. Secondary and tertiary prevention are based on the management of the lymphoedema-related morbidity and include foot hygiene, foot care, wound care, compression, exercises, elevation of the legs and treatment of acute infections.  Certain endemic countries are taking the initiative to include podoconiosis in their national plans for the control of neglected tropical diseases and to scale up interventions against the disease. Advocacy is needed for provision of shoes as a health intervention. We suggest case definitions and elimination targets as a starting point for elimination of the disease. ",

AIM To make a comparative clinical and economic evaluation of the use of the combination drug Influnet in the treatment of acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI).  SUBJECTS AND METHODS A total of 103 medical records of outpatients with uncomplicated mild and moderate ARVI were studied.  There were three groups: 1) 35 patients who received therapy with Influnet; 2) 31 patients who took Rinza; 3) 34 patients who were on treatment without the combination drug. RESULTS Analysis of comparative clinical effectiveness of the drugs revealed that the use of Influnet was accompanied by the rapider alleviation of fever and other ARVI symptoms and by its shorter treatment duration (4.5 \u00b1 0.5 days) versus that of Rinza (5.5 \u00b1 1.4 days) and monocomponent drugs (5.6 \u00b1 1.2 days). Economic analysis showed that in terms of indirect costs associated with shorter temporary disability in patients with ARVI, Influnet therapy was more economically sound for them.  CONCLUSION The results demonstrate the higher clinical and economic feasibility of Influnet therapy for ARVI versus its alternative therapy.  Combination drugs cause fewer adverse reactions than a combination of monocomponent drugs used to treat ARVI and are more cost- effective for the patient. ",

AIM  To investigate the effect of sildenafil on the survival of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) associated with connective tissue diseases (CTD), who have been followed up at the Rheumatology Expert Center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A total of 16 patients (all women) with PAH associated with CTD, who had been admitted to the V. A. Nasonova Research Institute of Rheumatology in 2013-2015, were examined. PAH corresponded to Functional Class II in the majority of the patients.  After the diagnosis was verified by catheterization of the right heart and pulmonary artery, all the patients received original sildenafil (a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, a potent vasodilator, the efficiency of which was proven in patients with PAH) at a dose of 20 mg thrice daily. Survival rates and time to clinical deterioration were estimated during a prospective follow-up). RESULTS Three-year survival rates were 94% in the study group and 25% in the group of historical control (p < 0.05). The time to clinical deterioration was associated with the duration of the follow-up and hemodynamic parameters (right atrial pressure and changes in vascular resistance within 4 months after therapy initiation). CONCLUSION The administration of sildenafil substantially improves survival in patients with PAH associated with CTD as compared with the historical control. The identification of poor prognostic factors in this cohort of patients and early diagnosis will favor the personification of therapy for the fatal manifestation of CTD. ",

    "text": "AIM  to determine optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography signs of classic and occult choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and evaluate their information value in monitoring the effect of anti-VEGF therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study enrolled 76 patients (87 eyes), including 68 patients (72 eyes) with wet AMD and 8 patients (15 eyes) with no signs of neovascularization. All patients underwent spectral-domain OCT, OCT angiography, and fluorescein angiography (FA). OCT angiography was used to evaluate neovascular networks in terms of their location, shape, size, and extent of visualization. Sensitivity and specificity of the method were assessed separately in a group of 37 CNV eyes and 15 unsuspicious eyes, specific findings at FA being the main diagnostic criteria. To determine the information value of OCT angiography in monitoring the effect of intravitreal ranibizumab therapy, 9 patients (9 eyes) were selected, in whom the exam was performed the day before the injection and then at days 3, 10, 17, 24, and 31. RESULTS The patients were divided into two groups.  Group 1 consisted of 43 eyes with occult CNV, group 2--of 29 eyes with classic CNV. Neovascular loops underneath the retinal pigment epithelium were found in 76.74% of occult CNV cases.  In patients with classic CNV, the neovasculature was clearly visible in 82.76% of eyes, loop-like and tree-like networks occurring with similar frequency (51.72% and 42.28% respectively). OCT angiography results obtained prior to and following ranibizumab injection revealed a change in not only the size of neovascularization, but also the density, thickness, and branching pattern of newly formed blood vessels. Sensitivity and specificity of OCT angiography has been shown to be 89.2% and 93.3% respectively. CONCLUSION OCT angiography enables diagnosis of both classic and occult choroidal neovascularization in patients with AMD as well as dynamic assessment of the size of the neovascular complex during anti-VEGF treatment. The method has high sensitivity and specificity. ",

INTRODUCTION High incidence of necrotic and suppurative complications is feature of acute post-traumatic pancreatitis.  Severe trauma of the pancreas and post-traumatic pancreatitis lead to depressurization of ductal system that requires adequate drainage of damaged area and retroperitoneal fat. MATERIAL AND METHODS 95 patients in group 1 received standardized treatment. The victims of the 2nd group (44 patients) were treated using immunoreactive therapy (roncoleukin) and octreotide (the dose depended on the severity of pancreatitis) at early stages.  The efficacy of treatment was assessed based on clinical, laboratory and instrumental parameters. RESULTS  Regardless severity of pancreatic injury overall mortality in groups 1 and 2 was 41% and 20.5% respectively. The main causes of adverse outcomes are severe destructive pancreatitis, postnecrotic suppurative complications. CONCLUSION Adequacy rather radicalism of surgery should be preferred for blunt pancreatic trauma management.  Minimally invasive surgical techniques and new methods of biological hemostasis may be applied. Timely use of anti-enzymatic and immunoactive therapy reduces the risk of severe post-traumatic pancreatitis, suppurative complications and improves outcomes in patients with blunt pancreatic trauma.

    "text": "[Evaluation of corneal biomechanics before and after up-to-date keratoplasty in patients with bullous keratopathy]. UNLABELLED Aim - to study biomechanical properties of the cornea in patients with bullous keratopathy before and after keratoplasty.  MATERIAL AND METHODS Ocular response analyzer (ORA, Reichert) indices were studied in 37 patients (37 eyes) with bullous keratopathy before and after surgery - in 1, 2, and 6 months and then in 1, 2, 3, and 5 years.  The following keratoplasty modifications were performed: ultrathin Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (UTDSAEK) - in 17 cases, microkeratome-assisted posterior keratoplasty (MAPK) - in 13 cases, half top-hat penetrating keratoplasty (HTH PK) - in 7 cases. RESULTS Corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CRF) values were significantly decreased in non-operated bullous keratopathy eyes as compared to healthy ones (p<0.05). By the 6-month follow-up these parameters have been found to be partially recovered and stabilized in all groups, however, still lower than normal (p<0.05). Differences between the groups were never statistically reliable, not at any time after surgery. Moreover, in eyes with bullous keratopathy, the mean corneal-compensated intraocular pressure (IOPcc) exceeded the mean Goldman-related IOP (IOPg) by 2.4 mmHg.  One month after keratoplasty the difference between IOPcc and IOPg was 2.7, 4.3, and 3.6 mmHg in the MAPK, UTDSAEK, and HTH PK group, respectively; in 6 months - 2.6; 2.4 and 3.6 mmHg, respectively (p<0.05). In the fellow healthy eyes the two IOP measurements were not statistically different. CONCLUSION Chronic edema of the cornea results in alteration of its viscoelastic properties. It has been shown that CH and CRF values decrease significantly in the eye involved as compared to the fellow healthy eye. After keratoplasty, regardless of the exact modification, these parameters partially recover, but remain lower than normal for at least 5 years as it was in our study. Neither before the surgery (when the cornea is chronically swollen), nor after, does corneal thickness correlate with its biomechanical indices. Postoperative reduction in corneal rigidity in eyes with bullous keratopathy may be confusing and lead to underestimation of the true level of IOP, thus, causing delays in diagnosis of concomitant glaucoma.

AIM To evaluate results of circular resection and carina reconstruction in patients with bronchial cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS  Study included 82 patients with bronchial malignant tumors operated for the period from 1998 to 2014. Mean age was 56\u00b11.1 years (range 24-75). There were 75 men and 7 women.  Squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, dimorphic cancer, carcinoid, adenocystic cancer, small cell cancer and clear cell renal cancer were observed in 66, 9, 1, 3, 1, 1 and 1 patients respectively. Stages IIB, IIIA, IIIB and IV were determined in 5 (6.2%), 45 (56.3%), 28 (35%) and 2 (2.5%) patients respectively. Tracheal carina resection was combined with right-sided pneumonectomy in 62 (75.6%) patients, left-sided pneumonectomy - in 5 (6.1%) cases, right upper lobectomy - in 10 (12.2%) cases. 3 patients underwent carina resection alone.  Plasty with bronchopulmonary segment of right upper lobe was applied in 2 cases. Since 2002 primary bronhomyoplasty using m.latiss.dorsi, m.intercostalis and m.serr.anterior flaps has been used in 64 patients. RESULTS Postoperative complications occurred in 31.7% (26) of patients.  In-hospital mortality was 10.1%. Use of primary bronhomyoplasty and head adduction reduced broncho-pleural fistula incidence and mortality (p<0.05). Long-term results in T3-T4N0 tumors were significantly better compared with T3-4N1-2 tumors (5-year survival 41.2 vs. 16.8%, p<0,05).

UNLABELLED The aim of the study was to assess the capabilities of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in diagnosis of the glioma proliferative activity and to evaluate a relationship between the glioma proliferative activity index and diffusion parameters of the contralateral normal appearing white matter (CNAWM). MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 47 patients with newly diagnosed brain gliomas (23 low grade, 13 grade III, and 11 grade IV gliomas). We determined a relationship between absolute and normalized parameters of the diffusion tensor (mean (MD), axial (AD), and radial (RD) diffusivities; fractional (FA) and relative (RA) anisotropies) and diffusion kurtosis (mean (MK), axial (AK), and radial (RK) kurtosis; kurtosis anisotropy (KA)) and the proliferative activity index in the most malignant glioma parts (p<0.05). We also established a relationship between the tensor and kurtosis parameters of CNAWM and the glioma proliferative activity index (p<0.05). RESULTS The correlation between all the absolute and normalized diffusion parameters and the glioma proliferative activity index, except absolute and normalized FA and RA values, was found to be statistically significant (p<0.05). Kurtosis (MK, AK, and RK) and anisotropy (KA, FA, RA) values increased, and diffusivity (MD, AD, RD) values decreased as the glioma proliferative activity index increased. A strong correlation between the proliferative activity index and absolute RK (r=0,71; p=0.000001) and normalized values of MK (r=0.8; p=0.000001), AK (r=0.71; p=0.000001), RK (r=0.81; p=0.000001), and RD (r=-0.71; p=0.000001) was found.

UNLABELLED Awake craniotomy is recognized as method that can decrease the frequency of neurological complications after surgery for gliomas located near eloquent brain regions.  Unfortunately good neurological outcome canot be ensured even by using of this technique. This paper discusses reasons and possible ways of prevention of such complications.  MATERIAL AND METHODS 162 awake craniotomies were performed in our clinic.  RESULTS 152 of patients were discharged from the clinic with good outcome.  In 10 (6%) cases sustained severe neurological deficit was noted. These complications were associated with anatomic or ischemic injury of subcortical pathways and internal capsule. CONCLUSION Awake craniotomy is effective instrument of brain language mapping and prevention of neurological deterioration.  Severe neurological complications of awake craniotomy are associated with underestimate neurosurgical risks, especially in terms of blood vessel injury and depth of resection. The main way of prevention of such complications is meticulous planning of operation and adequate using of mapping facilities. ",

Melatonin, a neurohormone synthesized by the epiphysis and extrapineal structures, has several functions including chronobiotic, antioxidant, oncostatic, immunomodulating, normothymic and anxiolytic ones.  It impacts on the cardiovascular system and the gastrointestinal tract and is involved in reproductive functions, metabolism and body mass regulation. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of melatonin in pain syndromes. The authors present a literature review on the studies of melatonin in treatment of fibromyalgia, headache, irritated bowel syndrome, chronic back pain and rheumatoid arthritis.  Possible mechanisms of analgesic properties of melatonin are discussed. On one hand, there is the improvement of sleep and activation of own adaptive potential of melatonin by normalizing circadian rhythms inevitably disturbed in chronic pain syndromes.  On the other hand, there are the data on the analgesic effect of melatonin realized through melatonin receptors and several neurotransmitter systems. ",

OBJECTIVE To analyze the therapeutic effect of valdoxan on symptoms of anhedonia in patients with endogenous depressions and to develop indications for its use.  MATERIAL AND METHODS Authors examined 30 women, mean age 35,9 years with anhedonic depression (ICD-10 items F31.3-4, F33.1-2, F20.4). Valdoxan was administered in average daily dose from 25.8 to 45.8 mg during 30 days. Patient's status was assessed on 0, 7, 14 and 30th days, using clinical and psychometric (HAMD-21, HADS, SHAPS and UKU scales) methods. The reduction of scores was used as a measure of therapeutic effect designated as \u00abmild\u00bb, \u00abmoderate\u00bb, \u00abgood\u00bb and \u00abmarked\u00bb. RESULTS Antianhedonic effect of valdoxan on 30th day was superior to thymoleptic and anxiolytic effects of this drug (91.5 versus 82.2 and 76.9%). The marked effect was identified already on 14th day and enhanced to 30th day. The best effect was seen in depression of moderate severity. Single autonomic side-effects of the treatment were observed. CONCLUSION The course treatment of anhedonic depressions with valdoxan should be considered as preferable and highly effective method that provides a dominative antianhedonic effect in the spectrum of antidepressive properties of the drug. Good and marked effects have been achieved in 96.7% of patients. The intensity and rate of its formation, good tolerability allow to tailor indications of valdoxan basing on the psychopathological characteristics of hedonic disorders. ",

AIM  To investigate the relationship between resistin, adiponectin, leptin, and hormonal and metabolic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and in those with its concurrence with asthma. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-seven patients with T2DM and 26 patients with T2DM concurrent with asthma were examined. The examination data of 23 apparently healthy women served as a control. Anthropometric measurements, carbohydrate and lipid metabolic parameters, and leptin, resistin, adiponectin, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 levels were studied. RESULTS Hyperleptinemia, hyperresistinemia, and lower adiponectin concentrations were found in the patients with T2DM and in those with its concurrence with asthma. These changes in the patients from these groups occurred in the presence of subclinical inflammation. Obvious insulin resistance (IR) accompanied by compensatory hyperinsulinemia was identified in the examined women. The detected atherogenic dyslipidemia appeared as increases in the levels of total cholesterol (C), triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein C, and atherogenic index and as a decrease in those of high-density lipoprotein C. The women with the concurrence of the diseases showed a positive correlation of the level of resistin with insulin and the HOMA index. CONCLUSION The patients with T2DM and those with its concurrence with asthma exhibited obvious IR accompanied by compensatory hyperinsulinemia. Hyperresistinemia plays a role in the development of IR in the concurrence of these diseases. The patients with T2DM and those with its concurrence with asthma were found to have hyperleptinemia, hyperresistinemia, and a trend for decreasing adiponectin values in the presence of subclinical inflammation.

AIM  To estimate the urinary excretion of markers for podocyte injury, to specify their value for the early diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy (DN), and to access the risk of its progression in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) with varying degrees of albuminuria/proteinuria. SUBJECT AND METHODS Seventy-four diabetic patients (30 with type 1 DM and 44 with type 2 DM) were examined and divided into 3 groups according to the urinary concentration in one urinary portion: 1) 41 patients with normal albuminuria (NAU) (<20 mg/l); 2) 13 patients with microalbuminuria (MAU) (20-200 mg/l); 3) 20 patients with proteinuria (PU) (>200 mg/l). A control group included 10 healthy individuals. The urinary levels of the podocyte structural proteins nephrin and podocin were determined by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS Nephrinuria (NU) was detected in 63, 77, and 80% of the patients with NAU, MAU, and PU, respectively. Podocinuria (PDU) was found in 78, 54, and 83% of those with NAU, MAU, and PU, respectively. NU in DN with PU was significantly higher than that in DM with NAU. In the NAU, MAU, and PU subgroups, podocin excretion was equally higher and did not differ between the types of DM. There was a direct correlation of NU with albuminuria, which was stronger in the MAU subgroup. In the patients with DM with varying degrees of albuminuria, the values of NU and PDU correlated directly to serum creatinine levels and inversely with glomerular filtration rate. NU directly correlated with glycated hemoglobin levels in the patients with types 1 and 2 DM of less than 5 years' duration and a direct significant correlation of systolic blood pressure with NU was found in those with type 2 DM. CONCLUSION Determination of urinary nephrin and podocin levels may be used for the early preclinical diagnosis of DN and the monitoring of the glomerular apparatus in DM. ",

MATERIAL AND METHODS Ileal biopsy specimens from 42 patients aged 22 to 55 years, including 16 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 14 with indeterminate colitis of IBD unclassified (IBDU), and 12 with the unchanged ileal mucosa (a comparison group). Immunohistochemical examination was performed using anti-somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR-2) antibodies (Epitomics, USA). SSTR2-positively stained cells were counted per 100 epitheliocytes. RESULTS There were three receptor expression types: predominantly membranous, cytoplasmic, and mixed (membranous-cytoplasmic). Calculation of cells with membranous expression indicated that the median was 1 in the patients with Crohn's disease (interquartile range (IQR) 0.5), 3 in those with IBDU (IQR 2.5), and 2 (IQR 2) in the comparison group. These indicators were 1 (IQR 2), 3 (IQR 2), and 2 (IQR 1) for cytoplasmic expression and 5 (IQR 4), 2 (IQR 3), and 3 (IQR 2) for membranous-cytoplasmic one. CONCLUSION The number of SSTR-2-expressing cells was significantly smaller in the patients with Crohn's disease than that in those with the unchanged mucosa and in those with indeterminate (unclassified) colitis.  There were three SSTR2 staining types: predominantly membranous, cytoplasmic, and mixed (membranous-cytoplasmic). The cells with membranous staining appeared to be neuroendocrine, those with cytoplasmic expression were intraepithelial T lymphocytes, and those with membranous-cytoplasmic expression were both neuroendocrine and epithelial.

AIM To study the clinical efficacy and safety of the combined medication ARTRA MSM FORTE (400 mg chondroitin sulfate, 500 mg glucosamine hydrochloride, 300 mg methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), and 10 mg sodium hyaluronate calculated with reference to hyaluronic acid) in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). SUBJECTS AND METHODS The study enrolled 100 patients with Kellgren-Lawrence grades 2-3 knee OA with obvious pain syndrome (pain intensity scores on a visual analog scale (VAS)) equal or greater than 40 mm during walking. The patients were examined monthly; changes in WOMAC index scores, Get-Up and Go test results, the efficiency of therapy in the opinion of a physician and a patient, and quality of life according to the EQ-5D questionnaire were estimated. They were randomized into 2 groups: 1) 50 patients took ARTRA MSM as 2 tablets daily for one month, then 1 tablet daily; 2) 50 received ARTRA in accordance with the same scheme. Clinical examination was performed before and at 30, 60, 90 and 120 days of the study. RESULTS All the 100 patients completed treatment. Analysis of the results showed a significant decrease in pain on VAS in both groups. Reduced pain intensity was observed by the end of the first month of therapy and remained throughout the follow-up. Both medications diminished stiffness just after a month of therapy. They alleviated joint function and reduced total WOMAC scores at Visit 2. Analysis of Get-Up and Go test results indicated significantly less spent time in both groups; however, these differences reached the statistical significance in the ARTRA MSM group just at Visit 2 and in the ARTRA group only at Visit 3. The effect ARTRA MSM occurred more rapidly. This was confirmed by the patient and physician evaluations of the efficiency of treatment, which indicated that its positive effect occurred more rapidly in the ARTRA MSM group (p=0.02). Estimation of EQ-5D scores also showed positive results: there was a significant improvement of these indicators in the two compared groups at Visit 3. Both medications were very well tolerated and caused no adverse reactions; therapy was not discontinued. CONCLUSION ARTRA MSM is rapider in its effect: a significant improvement in Get-Up and Go test results and patient and physician evaluations of the efficiency of treatment. Additional interviews of the patients taking ARTRA MSM demonstrated that 36 (72%) of them reported a prompter pain relief than the ARTRA-treated patients. ARTRA MSM may be recommended for the treatment of OA in clinical practice. ",

The severity of CI was higher in patients with CKD, stages III-IV, compared to those with stages I-II (p<0.001). CKD predicted the development of CI (OR 27.32, 95% CI 4.3-72.9, \u0440<0.001). MRI revealed the focal lesions of the white matter in 30% of patients, leukoaraiosis in 23.3%, lateral ventricular dilatation in 50%, expressed dilatation in the sulci of brain hemispheres in 10%. There was a relationship between CI and male sex, hyperhomocysteinemia, anemia, abdominal obesity, left ventricular myocardial hypertrophy and age. The frequency and severity of CI was associated with the signs of atherosclerotic lesions of common carotid arteries and indices of arterial rigidity. CONCLUSION The more increased the CKD severity, the higher the severity of CI.  The dysfunction of frontal lobes plays a key role in the development of CI in patients with CKD, stages III-IV. CKD, stages III-IV, is an independent predictor of CI in people in predialysis stages. ",

OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy and safety of teraligen in patients with psychoautonomic syndrome comorbid to brain ischemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS  Forty-five patients, aged from 42 to 65 years (mean age 56 years), diagnosed with brain ischemia, stages I and II, with the signs of psychoautonomic syndrome were examined. Thirty-five patients received teraligen in the daily dose of 15 mg.  The control group comprised 10 patients who were not treated with this drug. The duration of treatment was 60 days. Neurological status, autonomic changes, cognitive functions and mental state were assessed during the treatment.  Neurophysiological examination (EEG and P300 event-related potential) were performed in the first and last visits. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The distinct positive dynamics of the decrease of psychoautonomic symptoms, cephalgic syndrome, sleep normalization as well as the improvement of cognitive function were noted. Good tolerability and no side-effects, in particular, those related to vascular disorders, were demonstrated. Clinical results were supported by the results of neurophysiological examinations.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate clinical efficacy and tolerability of electrode pharmaphoresis using preparations xefocam and mydocalm-richter in railway workers with low-back pain.  MATERIAL AND METHODS Authors carried out an open prospective noncomparative study of 16 patients, aged 21-82 years, with spinal osteochondrosis with root syndrome and radiculopathia of the lumbar/sacral spine with pain syndrome regardless of its duration. Treatment efficacy was assessed by the dynamics of pain syndrome severity based on the scores of a self-rated scale completed by the patient and the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Quality-of-life was assessed with the Oswestry Disability Index before and in the end of treatment. Clinical outcome was evaluated with the modified Nurick scale.  Electrode pharmaphoresis (the \"Farma T.E.B. Trans Epidermal Barrier Physio\" apparatus) was administered to all patients using xefocam (solution for injections 8 mg, 2 ml per procedure) and mydocalm-richter (solution for injections 100 mg, 2 ml per injection) in the lumbar/sacral spine. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION The high clinical efficacy of electrode pharmaphoresis using xefocam and mydocalm-richter was shown. The complex restoration study resulted in the reduction of pain syndrome in all patients. Pain severity was reduced to mild grade in 68.8% to the middle of treatment and in 93.8% patients in the end of treatment. As a consequence of pain reduction, the functional activity (quality of self-service, daily activities) increased significantly in 68.8% of patients. Positive treatment effect was noted in 100% of patients, good tolerability of this medication in 87.5%. ",

We present a medical history of a 30-year old male patient with fatal ischemic stroke, resulting from the right internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection provoked by repeated head tilts and verified by magnetic resonance imaging and pathomorphological examination. At admission, the high level of creatine phosphokinase (5284 un/ml, normal level<171) in the blood was found, the coagulation parameters were normal. Autopsy revealed intramural hematoma (IMH), which was located between the media and adventitia of the arterial wall, began at 3 cm above the common carotid artery bifurcation and extended to the base of the skull.  The lumen of the ICA at the level of the IMG and intracranial parts as well as of the middle cerebral artery was occluded by the thrombus. The histological examination of the right ICA wall found splitting, thinning, fragmentation, disrupters of internal elastic membrane, severe media fibrosis, myocyte necrosis at the site of the dissection with the surrounding leukocyte infiltration, as well as lymphocytic infiltrates, clusters of eosinophils in adventitia. Similar changes, except myocyte necrosis, were also found in intact (non-dissected) brain supplying arteries. In general, they were similar to those in fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Histochemical and electron microscopic studies of skeletal muscles showed signs of mitochondrial cytopathy.

The objective of the present work was to study peculiar features of the injuries to three spinal regions in the victims of a head-on car collision found in the passenger compartments of modern motor vehicles equipped with seat belts and other safety means.  It was shown that most frequent fatal injuries to the driver include the fractures of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae. These injuries are much less frequent in the passengers occupying the front and the right back seats.  The multilayer and multiple character of the fractures in different parts of the spinal column in the car drivers is attributable to more pronounced spine flexion and extension associated with injuries of this kind. The fractures of the lower cervical vertebrae in the front seat passengers occur more frequently than injuries of a different type whereas the passengers of the back seats most frequently experience fractures of the upper cervical vertebrae. The passengers of the left back seat less frequently suffer from injuries to the thoracic spine than from the fractures of the cervical and lumbar vertebrae.

AIM  To clarify the role of virus resistance in the efficiency of antiviral therapy with protease inhibitors (PIs) chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients, with moderate sensitivity to interferon-\u03b1. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eight Caucasian patients (4 men and 4 women) aged 21 to 65 years (median 52.5 years) with genotype 1b hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were included in the study. Two patients were diagnosed with liver cirrhosis; 4 had been ineffectively treated with peginterferon in combination with ribavirin. None of the patients had obesity and/or insulin resistance. All the 8 patients received triple therapy with PIs (boceprevir (n=3), telaprevir (n=4), and simeprevir (n=1)) and as a result failed to achieve a sustained virologic response. All the participants were studied to identify mutations in HCV NS3/4A region. RESULTS Five of the 8 patients were found to have mutations in HCV NS3/4A region (substantially reducing drug susceptibility in 3 cases).

MATERIAL AND METHODS APPs were measured in tears, oral fluid, and blood plasma from 22 adults and 34 children with ophthalmic herpes as well as 68 healthy controls using immunoturbidimetric and spectrophotometric methods of detection. RESULTS High levels of C-reactive protein and orosomucoid, low levels of ceruloplasmin, \u03b11-antitrypsin, and transferrin in tears from patients with herpes keratitis as well as abnormal tear, saliva, and plasma APPs levels at discharge are poor prognostic signs. They all indicate that corneal inflammation is still intense and that the treatment should not be ceased yet.  Severity of APPs concentration changes in tear from patients with herpes keratitis correlates with the depth of corneal lesions, recurrence rate, and disease dynamics.
