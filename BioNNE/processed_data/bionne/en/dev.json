CONCLUSION Education is an important factor to preserve cognitive abilities in patients with CAD. \nIn addition, the severity of coronary artery lesions and low cardiac contractility affect the degree of cerebral ischemia and neuronal dysfunction detected by spectral EEG power. \nThe efficacy of quantitative EEG analysis methods for early detection and prevention of cognitive disorders in CAD patients was confirmed. \n",

    "text": "[Long-term results of medical treatment in patients with a severe attack of ulcerative colitis]. AIM  To assess the long-term result of medical treatment in patients with a severe attack (SA) of ulcerative colitis (UC). SUBJECTS AND METHODS The course of UC was analyzed in 56 patients who were accessible by telephone contact and consecutively recruited for a year after therapy for a SA of UC. All the patients were stated to have a SA of UC according to the Truelove-Witts' criteria; they received therapy with intravenous glucocorticosteroids (GCS) (prednisolone 2 mg/kg) along with anti-recurrence therapy with mesalasine (5-ASA) or azathioprine (AZA). Ten (17.9%)  GCS-resistant patients were given infliximab (INF) (5 mg/ kg), followed by its maintenance infusions. Anti-recurrence therapy using 5-ASA, AZA, and INF was performed in 33 (58.9%), 13 (23.2%), and 10 (17.9%) patients, respectively. RESULTS During one year, 14 (25%) patients continued to be in clinical remission on maintenance therapy or to have attacks stopped without using GCS, immunosuppressive agents, or INF (a satisfactory response group). Colectomy was carried out in 23 (41.1%) patients; due to recurrent UC when decreasing the dose of GCS, 5 (8.9%) patients continued to take the latter during a year. A GCS cycle was repeated in 3 patients who had received AZA (the basic therapy was not corrected) and 11 patients who had taken 5-ASA. The prognostic factors for a long-term result of medical therapy included the choice of AZA as an anti-recurrent drug (57.1 and 11.9% in the satisfactory and poor treatment outcome groups, respectively; p = 0.004) and patient age (34.4 and 42.8 years, respectively; p = 0.0357). CONCLUSION During 1 year after a SA of UC, indications for colectomy and repeated GCS use occurred in 41 and 34% of the patients, respectively. The long-term efficiency of medical therapy for a SA of UC declines with advancing age. The use of AZA as an anti-recurrence agent after termination of GCS intake increases the probability of long-term clinical response. ",

OBJECTIVE To reveal the morphological features of the aorta in its dissection in persons of different age groups. MATERIAL AND METHODS  The operative material obtained after resection of the aorta for its dissection was examined. The fragments of the wall of the ascending aorta were fixed in 10% formalin solution immediately following its resection.  The material was treated by processing and fixing methods; paraffin sections were stained with hemotoxyllin-eosin, orsein by the Van-Gieson, MSB, and Leigh methods. RESULTS By analyzing 77 dissecting aortic aneurysm biopsy specimens, the authors presented the structural features of the aortic wall in terms of age-related changes. Examinations were made by light and electron microscopy using special stains. The signs of physiological or premature aging were assessed by elastic skeleton changes. There was a deficiency of collagen and its impaired maturation in all the study cases of vascular aging in the presence of aortic dissection. CONCLUSION Quantitative and qualitative changes in the smooth muscle cells were due to both patient age and concomitant hypertension. In young patients, aortic dissection was more frequently caused by a genetically determined disorder in the elastic skeleton in obvious substitutive sclerosis. ",

OBJECTIVE To investigate the morphogenesis of vocal fold polyps and Reinke's edema on the basis of clinical and morphological analyses of the histological and immunohistochemical data characterizing the state of the local microcirculatory bed and the mechanisms of its permeability impairment.  SUBJECTS AND METHODS Polyps of the vocal folds and their mucosal tissue samples in Reinke's edema mucosa, which had been obtained after microsurgical treatment of 31 patients (13 men and 18 women) aged 23 to 75 years, were studied using a wide panel of peroxidase-labeled monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies (DAB chromogen), including T and B cell differentiation markers, Toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9), the costimulatory molecule CD80 (B7- 1), and markers for angiogenesis (CD34), vascular and tissue permeability (matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-9)), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Results. All types of the examined polypoid hyperplasia were ascertained to realize through the impaired permeability of the wall of microcirculatory vessels in the membranous vocal fold portion called Reinke's space. The expression of molecules, such as CD34, VCAM-1, MMP-1 and MMP-9, as well as TLR4 and TLR9 was revealed on the endothelial cells of microcirculatory vessels. The epithelial lining cells simultaneously expressed the above-mentioned Toll-like receptors and the costimulatory molecule CD80 (B7-1) that modulated T cell lymphocyte activity (through CD28) or attenuation (through CTLA-4), ensuring the interaction of structures of innate and adaptive immunity. CONCLUSION The morphogenesis of polypoid hyperplasia of the vocal folds is a result of an epithelial stromal interaction under poor etiological factors, such as high vocal loads, exogenic intoxications, and viral infections. The integumentary lining cells carrying Toll-like receptors initiate reactive alterations in Reinke's space. ",

BSS was injected into the fellow eye for control.  Group 2 (7 rabbits) also received sterile intracameral injections of 0.2 ml antibiotics and antifungals, which were the same as for group 1 but highly diluted (Moxifloxacin 150 \u03bcg/ml and 500 \u03bcg/ml, Diflucan 10 \u03bcg/ml, asketin cefuroxime 1 mg/ml, gentamicin 200 \u03bcg/ml, amikacin 400 \u03bcg/ml, amphotericin B 10 \u03bcg/ml). RESULTS There were no toxic effects in group 1 after BSS and Moxifloxacin 1.6 mg/ml injections into the anterior chamber. However, high concentrations of other antibiotic and antifungal drugs were associated with changes in the corneal endothelium of various severity (from cytoplasmic swelling of the endothelial cells to their complete desquamation), as well as fibrin exudation in the posterior chamber.  In group 2 neither of injected drugs caused toxic, allergic, or inflammatory reactions according to histopathological examination. CONCLUSION The experiment proved safety of the intracameral route of administration for highly diluted medications from the list and also demonstrated the absence of toxic reaction after intracameral injection of Moxifloxacin 1.6 mg/ml.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate changes in the functional properties of nasal cavity mucosa during the treatment of the patients of different age groups presenting with acute rhinosinusitis.  The following methods were used for the purpose: daily measurement of pH, body temperature, pain sensitivity threshold in the intranasal mucous membrane, mucociliary transport (MCT) time; in addition, joulemetry was performed to examine the patients suffering from acute rhinosinusitis. The study has demonstrated marked differences in the functional conditions of nasal cavity mucosa associated with the treatment.  The aged and elderly patients were characterized by lowered mucosal temperature at all stages of therapy, elevated pain sensitivity threshold, and long duration of the recovery of ciliary epithelium activity that reflected non-responsiveness inherent in the patients of this age group. The direct joulemetry technique made possible the most detailed evaluation of dynamics of these pathological changes in nasal cavity mucosa and its age-specific features. It is concluded that the clinical manifestations of acute rhinosinusitis are characterized by well apparent age-specific features that should be taken into consideration in diagnostics and treatment of this condition. The comprehensive evaluation of the parameters of the functional state of nasal cavity mucosa associated with this pathology allows the severity of inflammation and the effectiveness of its treatment to be estimated; moreover, it permits to correcte in due time the scope of the prescribed therapy.

OBJECTIVE EEG changes in schizophrenic patients are caused by a multitude of factors related to clinical heterogeneity of the disease, current state of patients, and conducted therapy. EEG spectral analysis remains an actual methodical approach for the investigation of the neurophysiological mechanisms of the disease.  The goal of the investigation was the study of frequency and regional EEG correlating with the intensity of productive and negative disorders. MATERIAL AND METHODS Models of summary prevalence of positive/negative disorders and evidence of concrete clinical indices of the PANSS scale were used. Spectral characteristics of background EEG in the frequency range of 1-60 Hz were studied in 35 patients with paranoid schizophrenia free from psychoactive medication and in 19 healthy volunteers. RESULTS It was established that the main index of negative symptomatology in summary assessment was diffuse increase of spectral power of gamma and delta ranges. Deficient states with the predominance of volitional disorders were characterized by a lateralized increase of spectral power of beta-gamma ranges in the left hemisphere, and of delta range - in frontal areas of this hemisphere. Positive symptomatology was noticeably less reflected in EEG changes than negative ones. CONCLUSION An analysis of psychopathological symptom complexes revealed the significance of spatially structured EEG patterns in the beta range: for the delusion disturbances with psychic automatism phenomena - in frontal areas of the left hemisphere, and for the paranoid syndrome with primary interpretative delusion - in cortical areas of the right hemisphere.

OBJECTIVE To explore the dynamics of hemostasis in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the combination with anxiety and depressive disorders (ADD) during therapy with valdoxan (agomelatine).  MATERIAL AND METHODS We examined 196 male and female patients (mean age 64.2 \u00b1 0.8 years) in the first 24 hours of ACS.  The patients were divided into three groups: patients with ACS without ADD (n=88), patients with ACS and ADD without valdoxan therapy (n=58) and patients with ACS and ADD treated with valdoxan (n=50). Coagulation and vascular-platelet hemostasis were studied in the first 24 hours of hospitalization and in the 10th day of hospitalization.  RESULTS Patients with ACS revealed high levels of fibrinogen, soluble fibrin-monomer complexes, D-dimer at all stages of the study.  In patients with ADD, these parameters were significantly higher compared to patients without ADD. The levels of D-dimer in the 10th day were similar in patients with ADD treated with valdoxan and in patients with ACS without ADD. In both groups of patients with ADD, the levels of spontaneous aggregation in the first and 10th days of hospitalization were not significantly higher than in the control group and in patients with ACS without ADD. All patients with ACS had high values of platelet aggregation stimulated by adenosine diphosphate in dose 0.1 uM.  In patients with ACS and ADD treated with valdoxan, a significant reduction of these parameters was noted in the 10th day of treatment compared to the first day of hospitalization.

AIM To elucidate the safety profile and symptom-modifying effect of Alflutop and diacerein in the treatment of Kellgren-Lawrence Stages II-III knee osteoarthrosis (OA) in patients with oxalate nephropathy and Stages I-II chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to refine the effect of these drugs on urinary syndrome and renal function as compared to a response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs--cyclooxygenase inhibitors (diclofenac). SUBJECTS AND METHODS This open-label comparative randomized trial enrolled 86 female patients with Kellgren-Lawrence Stages II-III primary gonarthritis concurrent with oxalate nephropathy and Stages I-II CKD. The patients were randomized into 3 groups: 1) 20 patients took diclofenac sodium 100 mg/day; 2) 30 received a complex pharmaceutical on the basis of glycozaminoglycans Alflutop injection 1 ml per day for 20 days, then 2 ml intraartricular twice weekly in the following month; 3) 36 had diacerein (diaflex, \"Rompharm Company\") in a dose of 50 mg twice daily for 3 months. On day 30 and day 90 of treatment, the symptom- modifying effect was evaluated from changes in the joint pain and morning stiffness domains of the WOMAC index. Renal function was measured using the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), uric acid clearance (C(ua)), and urinary sediment. RESULTS On day 30 of treatment, the patients taking diclofenac were found to have nephrotoxic effects (lower GFR, C(ua), evolving secondary hyperuricemia, progressive proteinuria, emerging microhematuria, elevated urinary levels of total lipid hydroperoxides, and enhanced calcium oxalate crystalluria).  Alflutop and diacerein exerted no negative effects on renal function. On day 30 day of treatment, all the patient groups showed a reduction in the WOMAC pain score. The diclofenac group displayed a more marked decrease in the pain score than did the two other groups by day 30. Otherwise by day 90 of therapy with Alflutop and diacerein, the pain scores were reduced by 60 and 67%, respectively, which was similar to those in the diclofenac group by day 30 of a follow-up.  By day 30 day of treatment, the stiffness score was also observed to fall in all the groups and achieved even lower values in the Alflutop and diacerein groups compared with diclofenac group. CONCLUSION  Alflutop and diacerein used by patients with knee OA do not produce nephrotoxic effects and by day 90 demonstrated similar to diclofenac symptom-modifying effect by reducing pain and stiffness scores. Diclofenac administration contributed to oxalate nephropathy progress. ",

    "text": "[Evolution of ideas on microscopic colitis].  The literature review gives the present-day views of the definition, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of microscopic colitis (MC). In the present view, MC is an inflammatory bowel disease of unknown etiology, which is characterized by chronic watery diarrhea, no macroscopic signs of large bowel involvement in the presence of specific pathomorphological changes. There are two major forms of MC, which are similar in its clinical picture, yet, heterogeneous in histological criteria: collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC).  As of now, the prevalence of MC is about 100 cases per 100,000 population, which is similar with that in other inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. MC generally prevails in women aged over 50 years.  The etiology and pathogenesis of MC have not fully investigated. Watery diarrhea is as a predominant pathognomonic symptom in all the patients with MC. The major histological criterion for the diagnosis of CC is subepithelial collagen lining thickening (more than 10 pm) and that for LC is higher intraepithelial lymphocyte counts (more than 20 intraepithelial lymphocytes/100 epitheliocytes). The topical glucocorticosteroid budesonide is currently the only agent, the efficacy of which has been proven in both inducing and maintaining remission in patients with MC in many clinical trials.

    "text": "[The mechanical properties of the bone tissue from the middle facial region].  The objective of the present work was to study age-related features of the reaction of the maxillary sinus cavity walls to a variety of impacts associated with the surgical interventions. To this effect, a variety of stress-strain conditions were simulated that are known to arise in the maxillary sinus cavity walls under the action of different force vectors taking into consideration the age-specific peculiarities of the mechanical structure of the bone tissue. The 3D model of the maxillary sinus cavity was built up based on the results of spiral computed tomography with the use of the Solid Works 2012 software package (USA).  The finite element method (FEM) was employed to construct the grid. Three variants of force application were simulated, one to the canine fossa region, another to the upper portion of the alveolar process at the border between the upper and lower walls of the sinus, and the third to the anterior part of the inferior nasal passage. The study has demonstrated that the bone wall of the maxillary sinus differently responds to the impacts of similar magnitude depending on the application point and age-related physical and mechanical properties of the bone tissue.  This finding should be taken into account in the choice of the optimal surgical approach to the maxillary sinus. It was calculated that endonasal interventions should be preferred for the treatment of patients above 60 years of age as the minimally injurious ones to the bone tissue.  Moreover, special caution is needed when the intervention is performed beneath the canine fossa, where the bone is extremely fragile and the risk of injury extension to the floor of the maxillary sinus is especially high.

    "text": "OBJECTIVE  To substantiate the reasonability and duration of angiographic follow-up of patients operated on for cerebral aneurysms to rule out de novo aneurysm formation. MATERIAL AND METHODS The results of angiographic examination (cerebral angiography and SCT angiography) of 43 patients with cerebral aneurysms operated on at the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute in 1995-2012 are analyzed. The follow-up duration varied from 1 to 14 years after surgery (mean duration, 5 years).  Patients' age ranged from 14 to 56 years. RESULTS Control angiographic examination showed that de novo aneurysms were formed in 7 (16.2%) patients. A total of 8 de novo aneurysms were detected (in one case there were two aneurysms formed). All aneurysms, both the previously operated and the de novo ones, were located in the anterior part of the circle of Willis. De novo aneurysms were clipped in 5 cases; the cavity of the de novo aneurysm was occluded with spirals in one case. One patient with a small aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery refused surgery. Neither lethal nor unfavorable outcomes were recorded. CONCLUSIONS The patient groups with the high risk of de novo aneurysm formation are as follows: 1) young smokers with hypertension; 2) patients who developed clinical signs of the disease when being young; 3) patients subjected to proximal exclusion of the main artery; and 4) patients with multiple and familial forms of the pathology. Dynamic angiographic follow-up (SCT angiography or magnetic resonance angiography) for 1-3 years is recommended for these patients. ",

AIM  To investigate the prognostic value of serum endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including that in the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). SUBJECTS AND METHODS Eighty-four patients (46 men, 38 women; mean age 63 \u00b1 11 years) with ACS were examined. Twenty-one (25%) patents were diagnosed with ECG ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STSEAMI), 12 (14%) had ECG non-STSEAMI, and 51 (61%) had unstable angina. Thrombolytic therapy was performed in 10 (48%) patients with STSEAMI. The patients whom had not undergone coronarography were included in the investigation to exclude the nephrotoxic effect of X-ray contrast agents. RESULTS AKI was observed in 7 of the patients with acute myocardial infarction and in only 1 of those with unstable angina. Four (5%) patients died during hospitalization. The EPO level of > 10.5 IU/ml predicted the development of AKI in the ACS patients with a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 67%. That of > 13.7 IU/ml was associated with hospital death in the ACS patients with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 75% (AUC = 0.93%).

MATERIAL AND METHODS A study included 178 patients, aged from 40 to 65 years, with low back pain during at least 12 weeks and the VAS score > 3. Patients were stratified into 6 groups (3 pairs of comparison). In the first pair, patients of the main group (n = 31) received APTPA (a combination of 500 mg of glucosamine hydrochloride and 500 mg of chondroitin sulfate) in dosage 1 tablet twice a day during 1 month and then 1 tablet during 2 months plus melaxen (3 mg of melatonin 30-40 min before sleep), patients of the control group (n = 29) received only APTPA. In the second pair, patients of the comparison group (n = 30) received APTPA in dosage 1 tablet twice a day and diclofenac in dosage 25 mg 2-3 times a day, patients of the main group (n = 30) received additionally melaxen (3 mg of melatonin 30-40 min before sleep). In the third pair, patients of the main group (n = 29) received APTPA in dosage 1 tablet twice a day, diclofenac in dosage 25 mg 2-3 times a day and melaxen (3 mg of melatonin 30-40 min before sleep), patients of the comparison group (n = 29) did not receive melaxen. Treatment results were assessed after 3 months for the first pair and after 1 month for the second and third pairs.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The first patient presented with bilateral panuveitis and unilateral keratomalacia (left eye).  For the latter, blepharorrhaphy was performed. Methylprednisolone (Metypred) and azathioprine pulses, subsequently switched to oral therapy, caused regression of uveitis.  In 1 month the patient was operated for retinal detachment and associated cataract in her right eye. The second patient presented with bilateral detachment of neuroepithelium.  Complete reattachment in both eyes was achieved with Metypred pulses followed by oral prednisolone and azathioprine. Bilateral panuveitis with pupil occlusion developed 6 months after the cessation of prednisolone, however, began to resolve as soon as the treatment was resumed. RESULTS Timely diagnosis and combination pulse therapy (methylprednisolone and azathioprine) enabled rapid resolution of acute condition. CONCLUSIONS Pulse Metypred is the mainstay of the treatment of VKH syndrome. Supplementing the treatment of autoimmune uveitis with low doses of azathioprine slows progression of the disease and minimizes prednisolone-induced side effects.  It is important that VKH patients are treated with pathogenetic therapy in close cooperation with an immunologist. Long-term monitoring (not less than 2-3 years) is also necessary. ",

Presented herein is a clinical case report concerning successful surgical treatment of an aneurysm of the upper superior mesenteric artery. Diagnosis included contrast-enhanced multispiral computed tomography. Thought the middle laparotomy we exposed an aneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery measuring 3 mm in diameter. A peculiarity of the aneurysm was that it was tightly adhered to the body of the pancreas and had a \"neck\" with pronounced signs of infiltration, with the latter extending to the right lateral and upper wall of the aneurysm. The aneurysm was resected along its \"neck\" which made it possible to suture the defect without residual stenosis and with no use of a synthetic patch. The woman was discharged on day 8 postoperatively in a satisfactory condition. Based on the morphological examination of the micropreparation the following diagnosis was made: fibromuscular dysplasia, aneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery. ",

Only surgical way of disease management seems impossible.  Thus multidisciplinary approach is necessary. AIM  To determine the effectiveness of actovegin in treatment of critical ischemia of lower extremities. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 60 patients (34 men, 26 women, mean age - 69.5 \u00b1 7.2 years) with confirmed atherosclerosis obliterans (critical limb ischemia stage III-IV with necrotic processes within the toes). Patients in the control group (n=30) received standard medical therapy including pentoxifylline (15 ml), rheopolyglukin (400.0 ml), antiplatelet agents (in some cases with dual antiplatelet therapy), low molecular weight heparins in prophylactic doses, statins. In the main group (n=30) actovegin in a daily dose of 1200 mg intravenously for 15 days, followed by 1200 mg in tablet form (2 tablets 3 times per day) for 15 days was added. Primary, 15-, 30- and 60-day pain-free walking distance and microcirculation using polarography and laser Doppler imaging were assessed in all patients. Cytological and histological studies were applied for double control of therapy's effectiveness. The reliability of the results of microcirculation investigation was achieved using an index of regional tissue perfusion. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Statistically significant improvement of transcutaneous oxygen tension has not been received in the control group. In the main group therapy with actovegin improved skin perfusion 35% by the 15th day and activated microcirculation 12.8% followed by increased tissue oxygenation. CONCLUSIONS Positive effect of actovegin on the development of collateral blood flow in patients with distal occlusion of the lower limbs is convincingly proven. ",

AIM To investigate the free radical oxidation of lipids, oxidative modification of protein activity of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase as well as the end product of nitric oxide - nitrite in the brain mitochondrial fraction of animals with experimentally induced cerebral edema and in treatment with taurine.  MATERIAL AND METHODS Toxic brain edema was induced in rats with intraperitoneal injection of tetra-ethyl lead (10 mg per kg of animal weight).  The intensity of peroxidation was evaluated by hydroperoxide and malonic aldehyde contents. RESULTS An analysis of the levels of oxidative modification of proteins revealed that brain edema was characterized by increased levels of oxidative modification of proteins and lipids, nitrogen oxide, reduced glutathione content and decrease in the activity of enzymes containing glutathione (glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase).  CONCLUSION On this basis, we suggested that drugs increasing glutathione content and activating enzymes containing glutathione, for example taurine, could be used as medications.  The introduction of taurine in dose of 50 mg/kg during 5 days led to the reduction of lipid peroxidation products, normalization of oxidative modification of proteins in the mitochondrial fraction of the rats with experimental cerebral edema.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 32 patients with alcohol dependence had been randomized into one of two treatment groups (16 patients in each): patients of the 1st group were treated with baclofen (50 mg/day) for 3 months while patients of the 2nd one received identically looking placebo. All the study subjects were scheduled to come to the clinic on the weekly basis to control alcohol use and compliance with the study medications (by riboflavin marker in urine) and also - for psychiatric evaluations (severity of craving for alcohol, anxiety and depression). Alcohol use evaluated with the Time Line Follow Back technique and gamma-glutamiltranspeptidase activity in blood. To assess anxiety Spielberger state-trait inventory and Hamilton scale were used.  Depression was assessed with Montgomery-Ashberg scale. To evaluate carving for alcohol used Obsessive-Compulsive Drinking scale, Penn Alcohol Craving scale, and Visual Analog Scale of Craving. Overall treatment effect assessed with the Clinical Global Impression scale. The study design was double blind. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Baclofen did no differ significantly from placebo on either of primary or secondary outcome variables.  However, primary outcome variables of retention in treatment and drinking were slightly better in the baclofen group compared to placebo, and those differences were close to the level of statistical significance. There were no differences between the groups in either rate of adverse events or liver enzymes activity which is an evidence of safety and good tolerability of baclofen in alcohol dependent patients.

    "text": "[The role of inherited thrombophilia and undifferentiated connective tissue dysplasia syndrome in the pathogenesis of female infertility: A clinical and morphological study].  UNLABELLED Impaired endometrial receptivity is a major cause of reproductive losses in in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles given a normal embryo.  Its causes may be associated with many diseases, including inherited thrombophilia (IT) and undifferentiated connective tissue dysplasia syndrome (uCTDS). However, endometrial receptivity remains little studied.  OBJECTIVE to investigate the morphological and immunohistochemical substrates of impaired endometrial receptivity in women with uCTDS, IT, and their concurrence. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Antibodies against ER, PgR, LIF, VEGF, and PAI-1 were used to morphologically and immunohistochemically examine pipelle endometrial biopsy specimens taken from 141 women in the implantation window (on days 6-7 after ovulation). In accordance with their clinical diagnoses, the patients were divided into 4 groups: 1) 13 patients with uCTDS; 2) 100 with IT; 3) 19 with uCTDS and IT; 4) 9 healthy surrogate mothers (a control group). In the examined groups, a total of 145 (90.1%) out of all the IVF protocols were unsuccessful. In the remaining 16 (9.9%) patients without exception, miscarriage started at less than 10 weeks' gestation. RESULTS In the implantation window, the endometrium was immature in 101 (83.1%) women and corresponded to late proliferation or early secretion phases; 102 (84.3%) women were also found to have no mature pinopodes, pointing to the fact that the endometrial receptivity was very low. Immunohistochemical examination revealed the lower expression of the receptivity marker LIF in the endometrial surface epithelium and its higher expression in the stroma in the study groups (p < 0.05 for the uCTDS and uCTDS+IT groups) and the higher expression of PAI-1 and VEGF in the epithelium, stroma, and endothelium in the study groups than in the control group (p < 0.05), suggesting the intensity of neoangiogenetic processes and impaired fibrinolysis in these patients. CONCLUSION uCTDS and IT are risk factors of impaired endometrial receptivity in the pathogenesis of infertility. The manifestations of impaired endometrial receptivity in this case are a decrease in mature pinopodes in the surface epithelium; focal stromal sclerosis; and redistribution of the receptivity marker LIF from the surface epithelium to the stroma, which may be used for diagnosis, prediction, and the development of targeted therapy.

    "text": "[Contribution of hemodynamic disturbances in magistral vessels to optic neuropathy progression and ocular tension changes in endocrine ophthalmopathy].  AIM to investigate the contribution of various hemodynamic disturbances in magistral vessels to optic neuropathy (ON) progression and ocular tension changes in endocrine ophthalmopathy (EOP).  MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 39 patients (78 eyes) with subclinical EOP (clinical activity score, CAS \u2264 2) associated with Graves' disease (n = 32, 64 eyes) or autoimmune thyroiditis (n = 7, 14 eyes) were examined. Orbit echography was performed in all patients. Blood flow was assessed with a Voluson 730 PRO ultrasound diagnostic system (\"Kretz\", Austria) in triplex mode (B-scan, color Doppler flow mapping in combination with pulse-wave Doppler). Thus obtained hemodynamic parameters in ophthalmic artery, central retinal artery (CRA), central retinal vein (CRV), short posterior ciliary arteries (SPCA), and long posterior ciliary arteries (LPCA) were analyzed. To reveal the role of hemodynamic disturbances in the above mentioned vessels in ON progression and eye pressure maintenance, the patients were divided into 7 groups. Only those eyes, whose peripheral indices were increased by more than 25% of normal values and diastolic blood flow decreased by not less than 25%, were selected for further study. Intraocular pressure changes were evaluated by group mean (Mmean = M \u00b1 m mmHg), optic neuropathy progression--by the difference in group mean depth (dB) and number of scotomas between the first and the last visit (6 months of observation). RESULTS In almost all types of perfusion disturbances, the resultant chronic ocular ischemia causes a decrease in IOP. The only exception, as shown, is simultaneous involvement of CRA, SPCA, and LPCA. The level of blood flow disturbance determines the severity of qualitative and quantitative changes in eyes with EOP-associated ON. The rate of ON progression directly correlates with baseline IOP values on day zero. CONCLUSION Long-lasting chronic impairment of blood supply of the eyeball leads to reduction in ocular tension and progression of optic neuropathy. Combined perfusion disturbances in CRA and LPCA as well as in CRA, LPCA, and SPCA can be considered a high-risk factor, while SPCA and/or LPCA involvement--a moderate-risk factor. ",

This prospective randomized study with double blind control was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of various anesthetic techniques employed prior to fibroendoscopy of the nose, nasopharynx, and larynx of the children. The study included 160 children at the age varying from 3 to 14 (mean 7.4\u00b12.96) years randomly allocated to four statistically comparable groups matched for age and sex. The following preparations were used to treat the children prior to fibroendoscopy: physiological solution (group 1), a 0.05% xylometazoline solution (group 2), a 10% lidocaine solution (group 3), and a mixture of 0.05% xylometazoline and 10% lidocaine solutions (group 4). The evaluation of the tolerance to the pretreatment of the nasal cavity with lidocaine and lidocaine plus xylometazoline (groups 3 and 4) showed that it was significantly (p<0.05) worse than in groups 1 and 2. The subjective tolerance to fibroendoscopy as reported by the patients was on the average similar in the children of all four groups (p>0.05). The doctors found the tolerance of fibroendoscopy to be the worst following pretreatment with the physiological solution (group 1) and the best after pretreatment with a mixture of lidocaine and xylometazoline (group 4) (p=0.03). The children comprising groups 2 and 3 were not significantly different in terms of the tolerance to fibroendoscopy (p>0.05). It is concluded that the pretreatment of the nasal cavity of the children with a 10% lidocaine solution before fibroendoscopy has no advantage over the pretreatment with a 0.05% xylometazoline solution; at the same time, insuflation of lidocaine as an anesthetic induces more pronounced negative emotions compared with the application of 0.05% xylometazoline.

    "text": "[Endoscopic endonasal removal of the invaginated odontoid process of the C2 vertebra].  UNLABELLED Pathological processes in the craniovertebral region (clivus, C1 anterior arch, odontoid process and body of the C2 vertebra, i.e. C0-C1-C2 segments) are very difficult to diagnose and treat.  The craniovertebral junction instability may develop in the case of a significant lesion of C1-C2 segments. Among diseases causing destruction of the clivus structures and C1-C2 vertebrae and compression of the spinal cord, the following ones are most common: chordoma, giant cell tumor, osteoblastoma, rheumatoid lesion, metastases, platybasia, and basilar impression. These diseases can cause the initial instability of the craniovertebral junction and be accompanied by gross neurological disorders, which complicates the diagnosis and surgical treatment of these patients.  MATERIAL AND METHODS We operated on two patients diagnosed with invagination of the odontoid process of the C2 vertebra.  In both cases, one-stage operation was performed that included occipitospondylodesis and endoscopic endonasal removal of the C2 odontoid process. RESULTS In the postoperative period, partial regression of the neurological symptoms was observed that included an increase in the strength and range of motions in the arms and distal legs, regressed spasticity in the arms and significantly reduced spasticity in the legs, and a significant improvement in all kinds of sensitivity in the arms, legs, and torso.  Postoperative liquorrhea was observed in 1 case (patient 2); re-operation to close a CSF fistula was conducted. Later, no signs of liquorrhea were noted. In both cases, control MRI and spiral CT revealed a postoperative bone defect of the C2 odontoid process and clivus, complete decompression of the medulla oblongata and upper cervical spine segments, and no evidence of spinal canal stenosis; the stabilizing system was competent and properly placed.  CONCLUSION The endoscopic endonasal approach, compared to the standard transoral approach, has significant advantages in that the soft palate remains intact, the oropharynx area is less damaged, and the hospitalization and rehabilitation duration is reduced. Also, there are no problems and complications such as possible failure of sutures in the oral cavity and a large wound surface in the oropharynx area.  The patient can eat on his own immediately after the operation without the use of a stomach tube (it does not cause any inflammatory complications of the oral cavity). However, the surgical technique of the endoscopic endonasal approach to the C1-C2 segment is more complex than that of transoral surgery and requires the surgeon to be skilled and experienced. ",

AIM To investigate the impact of therapy with the infusion hepatoprotector remaxol on liver function in cirrhosis in the outcome of chronic viral hepatitides (CVH): HCV, HBV, HCV+HBV, and HBV+HDV. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Sixty-five patients aged 26 to 76 years, who had been diagnosed as having liver cirrhosis (LC) in the outcome of CVH: HCV, HBV, HCV+HBV, and HBV+HDV were examined. During infusion therapy, every day 32 cirrhotic patients in the outcome of CVH B or C received intravenous remaxol 400 ml in a jetwise manner once daily for 11 days. A comparison group comprised 33 patients with the similar condition who had intravenous ademetionine 400 mg in a jetwise fashion during infusion therapy with crystalloids (400 ml of isotonic sodium chloride solution, Ringer's solution) for 11 days. RESULTS After an infusion therapy cycle, the study group patients were recorded to have more significantly reduced cytolytic and cholestatic parameters. The pronounced hepatotropic effect of the drug was confirmed by the rate of a decline in the average concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin. In the study group patients, the relative values of a decrease in the levels of these biochemical parameters were 29, 29, and 40% versus 15, 20, and 9% in the control patients. CONCLUSION Infusion therapy with remaxol in the combination treatment of the patients with viral LC not only improves liver function (reduces the degree of cytolysis, cholestasis), but also exerts a cytoprotective effect on peripheral blood cells (leukocytes, lymphocytes, platelets).

Odontogenic maxillary sinusitis represents 13-86% of the inflammatory processes of maxillofacial area, with the incidence range being explained rather by varying diagnosis criteria than the true incidence difference of odontogenic lesions. The aim of the study was to summarize the clinical and radiological characteristics of odontogenic sinusitis according to patients records in the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery of Omsk Clinical Hospital No11 and the oral surgery department of BUZ GKSP No1 in 2009-2014.  A total of 948 records of patient (aged 17 to 68 years) with maxillary sinusitis were identified. X-ray examinations were performed by CT PISASSO TRIO (\"KoYo\", South Korea) and MSCT Brillians 6 and Brillians 64 ((Philips HealthCare), Netherlands). Images were obtained in axial projection with slice thickness of 0.2-0.6 mm with multiplanar reconstructions (MPR) in a variety of direct and oblique projections. Altogether 664 patients were diagnosed with foreign bodies in the maxillary sinuses (filling material in 569 cases, roots or root fragments? implants, rubber drains, fragments of endodontic instruments in 95 cases). In 284 persons odontogenic cysts were found. Almost every fifth case was complicated by mycotic infection. Analysis of the results showed that only a multidisciplinary approach including dentists, maxillofacial surgeons, otolaryngologists and radiologists, as well as dental volumetric tomography or multislice CT can ensure the correct clinical and radiological approaches to determine the tactics of treatment in patients with sinusitis, reduce the incidence of relapses and chronic inflammatory processes in the maxillary sinuses.

    "text": "[Topochemistry of internuclear interneurons in the human brain stem in arterial hypertension]. OBJECTIVE To study the internuclear interneurons (IN) involved in the metabolism of nitric oxide, hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide in the caudal brainstem in healthy people and those with lifetime hypertension.  MATERIAL AND METHODS The study was performed on postmortem material of 8 healthy men and 19 men, aged 18-44 years, with lifetime arterial hypertension.  Immunohistochemistry methods for nNOS, HO-2, CBS and histochemical method for NADPH-diaphorase were used to study IN groups located between the giant and small cell reticular nuclei (IN1), small cell reticular nucleus and the nucleus of the solitary tract (IN2) surrounded by the lateral reticular nucleus (IN3). RESULTS IN differ in size, shape, length and structure of sprouts as well as the nature of relationships formed and intensity of immunohistochemical reaction.  The intensity of MN response to the high blood pressure depends on the cell size: qualitative and quantitative changes among the most small MN are mild. In contrast, in many major MN, structural changes, a significant reduction in the proportion of these cells, concentration and reaction rate are noted. More significant changes in quantitative indicators are found among nNOS-positive neurons. The reduction in the quantitative indicators depends on the localization of cells. In IN1, where there are many large IN, changes are more pronounced than in IN3 and IN2, which do not contain so many such cells.  CONCLUSION Central mechanisms of hemodynamic control include, at least, two groups of interneurons: intranuclear and internuclear.  However, among the latter, only large IN are responsive to increases in blood pressure that confirms their participation in the regulation of hemodynamics, Small IN maintain a relatively small organization and perform a stable, obviously, integrating function.

AIM to estimate the expression of p53 protein, effector caspases-3 and -7, and the antiapoptotic protein survivin in colorectal adenocarcinoma metastases to the liver in patients who have received preoperative cytotoxic and combined cytotoxic and target anti-VEGF therapies.  SUBJECTS AND METHODS Intraoperative samples from 122 patients with colorectal carcinoma metastases to the liver were immunohistologically examined.  The investigation included patients who had received preoperative treatment with cytotoxic drugs, combined cytotoxic and targeted anti-VEGF therapy. A control group consisted of patients who had not received preoperative anti-tumor drug treatment. RESULTS Expression of Caspase 3, including that of survivin, was significantly more frequently detected in the patients who had received combined cytotoxic and anti-VEGF therapy as compared to both those treated with only cytotoxic agents (p=0.00004) and the control group (p=0.0008) As compared to the latter, the women who had received cytotoxic therapy were found to have no survivin expression (p=0.015).  Investigation of the expression of caspase-7 and p53 revealed no statistically significant differences between the three groups. Addition of bevacizumab to preoperative standard therapy regimens for colorectal adenocarcinoma metastases to the liver leads to activated apoptosis in tumor cells, by enhancing the expression of effector caspase 3.  At the same time, standard cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens in women results in activated apoptosis, by decreasing the expression of the antiapoptotic protein survivin. ",

MATERIAL AND METHODS The study comprised 33 patients (23 women, 10 men, average age 54.5 years), including 12 people (36.4%) with CBI, stage I, and 21 (63.6%) with CBI, stage II. All patients had a single depressive episode of mild severity.  Diagnosis of affective and cognitive impairment was carried out using clinical and neuropsychological methods (the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the night sleep questionnaire developed by A.M. Vein, the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), the modified Mini-Cog method, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI-S, CGI-I) to assess the degree and dynamics of the disease, the Patient Global Impression (PGI) scale. The survey had been performed after 2,4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Agomelatine (valdoxan) was used 1 time per day in the evening in a dose of 25 mg (1 tablet). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Agomelatine improved sleep from the second week of treatment, reduced anxiety symptoms after six weeks and depressive symptoms after eight weeks. The improvement of cognitive functions was noted as well. No side-effects was observed. The results revealed the high antidepressive activity of the drug in treatment of mild depressive states in patients with chronic brain ischemia, the balanced spectrum of effects on anxiety, depression, insomnia, the positive effect on cognitive functions that allows to recommend agomelatine in treatment of patients with CBI.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly earlier known as Wegener's granulomatosis, is primary system necrotizing vasculitis of small and medium-sized vessels, which is characterized by the formation of foci of granulomatous inflammation. One of the target organs in GPA is the organ of vision.  Its affection may not only reduce quality of life, but also may lead to the severest complications even to fatal outcome. The affection varies in severity from slight inflammation of the ocular superficial structures to severe involvement of all orbital and ocular structures to develop complete blindness, including bilateral one.  GPA can affect any portion of the organ of vision. The changes are low specific, which makes early diagnosis and timely adequate therapy difficult. Overall all ophthalmologic manifestations can be divide into 4 groups: 1) lesions of the orbit and appendages; 2) those of the conjunctiva and fibrous tunic of the eyeball: 3) those of the retina: 4) those of the optic nerve. Orbital affection is characterized by the development of granulomas, dacryoadenitis with marked inflammatory infiltration of the surrounding tissues, including oculomotor muscles, and destruction of orbital bony walls. Nonspecific conjunctivitis and episcleritis are commonly encountered. Affection of the fibrous tunic of the eyeball is characterized by the development of necrotizing scleritis, peripheral ulcerative or stromal keratitis. The retina is rarely involved and mainly described as sporadic cases in the literature. The optic nerve is most commonly damaged due to the compression of the orbit by inflamed tissue; the lesion is more infrequently ischemic. ",

MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventy-eight hospitalized patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD were randomized into two groups: 1) 37 patients took nebulized budesonide 4 mg/day; 2) 41 patients received intravenous prednisolone.  The symptoms of COPD, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and other spirometric indicators, peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), and adverse events were studied. The serum levels of the soluble adhesion molecules CD50 (sCD50) and CD54 (sCD54) and the lymphocyte activation molecules CD38 (sCD38) and CD25 (sCD25) were investigated by an enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS There was a significant resolution of the symptoms of COPD, FEV1, and SpO2 in both groups after treatment. The incidence of hyperglycemia episodes was lower in the budesonide group than in the sGCS group. GCSs caused a decrease in the serum level of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sCD25) in both groups. A prednisolone cycle, unlike a budesonide one, was found to reduce the concentrations of sCD54, sCD50, and sCD38. CONCLUSION Nebulized budesonide is an effective and safe alternative to SGCS in treating an exacerbation of COPD. Inhaled GCSs, unlike SGCSs, exhibit anti-inflammatory activity, but exert no immunosuppressive activity. ",
